This application is part of a CI/CD demo with Travis and Google App Engine. The application is integrated with Travis and Google App Engine, and demonstrates how Travis CI can deploy and run end-to-end tests in a staging environment as part of the testing process, that is triggered by a git push command. 
## The deployed application
Deployed at https://my-react-application-275913.ew.r.appspot.com/.
## Run the app in development mode

- An account on GitHub and a repository containing your React application
- An account on Travis CI
- An account on Google Cloud Platform (free trial)
- Node/Npm installed on your computer
- Travis CLI so that you can execute the travis-commands in your terminal
